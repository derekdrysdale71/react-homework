This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Here is the solution to the homework problem.  I did include a ReusableComponent that can be changed out for the AboutView component and the UserView component.  It's perhaps not a very elegant solution to using a reusable component, but it works.

## In Order To Run

In the project directory, you can run:

 - Clone the repository
 - Run 'yarn init' or 'npm init' to load the required modules
 - Run 'yarn start' or npm start' to run the dev server

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
